## Head First Design principals executed in C#.

This project is a self-directed practice of the lessons presented in the book [Head First Design Patterns: A Brain-Friendly Guide](https://smile.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Brain-Friendly/dp/0596007124/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1519423944&sr=8-1-fkmr1&keywords=headfirst+design+principles) (standard Object Oriented design patterns written in Java) by translating the examples in to C#.   The purpose is to learn OO design patterns and foster a deeper understanding of C# OO design principals.
